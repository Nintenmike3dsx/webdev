    <h3>Steam Review:</h3>

    <blockquote cite="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199307678072/recommended/518790?snr=1_5_9__402"> <pre>
        "Very fun game, I like to play it on multiplayer with my family and we compare trophies and the like. After 220 hours of playing these are my thoughts. 
        The base game is very fun, but the DLC's are where the real meat of the game is (pun intended). Some of the <abbr title="Downloadable Content">DLC</abbr>'s like the atv and blinds/stands should 
        be included in the base game, because the game is very hard to play without them. I would have a hard time playing the game without tents, blinds, scopes, 
        rifles, and other DLC items that seem to be fundamental to the gameplay. I understand that this is the way that the game makes more money, but that should 
        be done through DLC maps and rare items, not things that everyone needs. However, this game is so replayable. Every time I hop on, I find new need zones and 
        parts of maps that I've never seen before. Currently, I've started a white tail deer grind on Laton Lakes. This is so much fun and I have a great time 
        hunting with a compound bow and deer callers. I would absolutely recommend this game because it has great replayability with new rifles and weapons to 
        try out, new sections of maps to discover, very fun multiplayer w/ challenges, and beautiful scenery."
