<h2>What to Start With First?</h2>

<p>When first starting its important to make sure your tree harvesting machines are working around the clock. Make sure they have plenty of <abbr title="Utility Trucks">UTs</abbr> to pickup any resources. Next, it is important to make sure you build your first blast furnace close to the iron scrap deposit. This will make sure your trucks have less distnace to travel when hauling resources.
The faster you can make Iron Bars, the better!</p>

<h2>What Research Should I Start With?</h2>

<p>When you first begin make 2 research centers. <mark>Make sure to create a deisel generator first!</mark> Once you have 2 research centers begin researching <i>Trading Dock</i> as well as <i>Vehicles and Mining.</i> This gives you a good launching point to start off your island!</p>

<h2>What Buildings Should I Make First?</h2>

<aside>
  <h4>Research Center</h4>
  <p>The research center is a key building to keep running. Always make sure you are researching at least 1 thing. Research can be qued so that you can leave the building running for a long period of time. <q>We should setup a Research Lab so we can reinvent all the technologies we took for granted for so long.</q></p>

  <h4>Water Catcher</h4>
  <p>It is key to create the water catcher as soon as you unlock it. Additionally research fluid storage as soon as possible. Concrete Blocks will become a necessity in order to facilitate Construction Parts.</p>

  <h4>Kins</h4>
  <p>Its important to start Concrete Block production as soon as possible to allow faster creation of construction parts. Your settlement expansion is dependant on construction parts. From the beginning the game encourages you to make construction parts.
    <hr>
    <blockquote>
"Besides our initial supplies we are starting from scratch. We should start manufacturing Construction Parts to be able to build our infrastructure."
</blockquote>
<p><hr>So make sure you have everything you need to make Construction Parts, the hardest of which will be Concrete Blocks. You can find more tips by pressing the Help <code>button</code> on the bottom panel. Additionally you can visit the online wiki for more information: <cite>https://wiki.coigame.com</cite></p>

  <h4>Basic Distiller</h4>
  <p>You begin the game with a decent amount of diesel to start with. However its common to forget to keep an eye on how much you have. Before you know it you will be running low and your trucks will not be able to transport good around your base.</p>
