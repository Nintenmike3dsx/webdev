        "i joined a lobby 
        funny dude and guy with a static-y mic say hi to me
        they teach me how to play
        guy with bad mic gets split up in the dark
        his horrible screams are heard down the hall
        his body flies past us
        me and other dude laugh
        our laughter turns to screams of horror as big black man with spikes on his body appears
        he chases us and snaps my neck
        other guy falls off metal beam and dies
        <q>you guys alive?</q>-radio man

        we did not meet quota
        10/10

        edit: week later i run the game with my buddy and his friend
        we buy yellow suits and romantic tables instead of flashlights
        we complain about not being able to see
        i got back to the ship and watch
        red dot moves at the speed of light towards buddy's buddy
        i teleport his body... moments too late
        i throw his body on the table
        i remember i left my buddy to die
        i teleport him back
        he screams at me
